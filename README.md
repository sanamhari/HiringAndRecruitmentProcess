HIRING AND RECRUITMENT  PROCESS USING MACHINE LEARNING
**Introduction**

Recruitment teams have access to a wealth of relevant candidate data in a connected 
and digital environment. However, it is far easier said than done to gather, compile, and 
analyze this data to support educated hiring decisions. Simply put, talent acquisition teams 
lack the time and resources to thoroughly evaluate each applicant's portfolio, identify 
passive job candidates, and create customized job descriptions. Machine learning can help 
with it. Many tedious and repetitive hiring processes can be automated with the help of this 
technology, freeing up time for hiring managers to concentrate on more strategic, value
adding duties. Nowadays HR department in multinationals prefer not to take a lot of time 
in focusing on the resume of a candidate as it will be tough job to check N number of 
candidates resumes to verify whether the given information about them is correct or not. 
For this purpose, a better solution would be an idea of converting this to an application. 

**Abstract**

In today’s competitive world, it is a very complicated process to hire candidates 
with manual verification of resumes. This work is an experimental method for ranking of 
hiring resumes because manually ranking is quite a complicated job for the hiring team, as 
it takes more time to go through each of the candidates resumes. If the resumes are high in 
number then man power will also increase for the same task. To rectify these problems a 
new solution has been proposed. In order to make this whole hiring process more effective, 
an application for processing the resumes using machine learning is proposed. This work 
uses methods such as optimizing the candidates’ performance in the preferred skill 
mentioned in the resume and also ranking method to display the selected candidates based 
on their overall performance according to the skill requirement of the company’s required 
job position. 

**System Study**

**Existing System**
1.The existing hiring and recruitment process typically relies on manual screening of resumes, interviews, and subjective evaluation by human recruiters. 
2.While some organizations may leverage Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) for initial resume parsing, the decision-making process is largely human-driven. 
3.The lack of automated and data-driven methodologies in the existing system may result in inefficiencies.
**Proposed System**
1.The machine learning involves the integration of advanced technologies to streamline and optimize candidate selection. 
2.Automated resume screening using machine learning algorithms will efficiently filter through a large pool of applicants.
3.Predictive analytics models will assess historical hiring data to predict candidate success.

**Modules**
**User**
1.The User can register the first. 
2.While registering he required a valid user email and mobile for further communications. 
3.Once the user registers, then admin can activate the customer. 
4.Once the admin activates the customer then the customer can login into our system. 
**Admin**
1.Admin can login with his credentials. 
2.Once he logs in he can activate the users. 
3.The activated user only login in our applications. 
4.The admin can set the predictions of algorithms.
5.Admin can predict random forest algorithms and also predict the support vector machine algorithm. 
6.The admin can add new data to the dataset.
**Prediction**
1.In prediction the user first gives the job description.
2.Next the user uploads the number of resumes he/she want at a time.
3.After submitting the job description and resumes the machine check the similarities between the job description and the resume content of each resume.
4.The output will be in the form of table.
5.The table contains rank  , email ,similarity percentage.  
**Machine Learning Techniques**
**TF-IDF Vectorization:**
1.This technique is a form of feature extraction widely used in information retrieval and text mining. 
2.It converts the job description and resume texts into numerical vectors.
**Cosine Similarity:**
1.The code calculates the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of the job description and each resume. 
2.Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors and is commonly used in information retrieval and document similarity tasks.
**HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS**
System      : Intel i3
Hard Disk		: 1 TB
Monitor     : 14’ Colour Monitor
Mouse       : Optical Mouse
RAM         : 4 GB
**SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS**
Operating system	 : Windows 10, 64 Bit.

Front-End		       : Html, CSS
Designing		       : Html ,CSS ,JavaScript
Database	         : SQLite

**Future Concept**

To further enhance the e-recruitment system, consider implementing a personalized learning path feature. 
This addition involves utilizing machine learning to analyze the skills and coursework data of successful hires over time. 
The system can recommend personalized learning paths for candidates based on their existing qualifications and the skills required for the job. 
This not only assists candidates in addressing skill gaps but also aligns their professional development with the organization's success criteria.

**Conclusion**

Using ML, it is possible to hire the employees based on their skill and course work they have done. Based on the suggested plan, an integrated e-recruitment system was proposed and implemented using Python.The use of our method shows that it is successful in determining the extraversion of job applicants and ranking them accordingly. The entire process makes the work of HR simplified and helps them focus on further tasks.
